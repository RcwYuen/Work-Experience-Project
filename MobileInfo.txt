How to actually do a mobile version of the website:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
Put this in the head of the html file.

CSS: 

@media screen and (max-width:1080px) {
  This means that CSS for screens that are 1080 pixels or less will be put in this section (I chose 1080 as that is the width of my phone screen)
}

^ Could be replaced by:

@media screen and (orientation:portrait) {
}
@media screen and (orientation: landscape) {
}


Potentially multiple css files for each different screen version:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen and (max-width: 360px)" href="portrait.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen and (min-width: 361px) and (max-width: 480px)" href="landscape.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen and (min-width: 481px)" href="desktop.css">
