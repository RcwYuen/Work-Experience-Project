 Current Bug List:

- Navbar links are blue - solution: text-decoration:none;

 Ideas:

- Javascript to support searching?

- Should we make every page the same in colour, font size, font type and make everything look similar rather than the main page being white and the pages I made are grey in background-colour?

+ Background color too dark - maybe #fcfcfc


Ideas for Mobile Friendly...

- Index page: Make the two columns stack vertically and shrink the nav bar ( or make it button activated in JS )
   For mobile having the news/reviews tab overflow is alright/preferable - as atm it just goes down the page
