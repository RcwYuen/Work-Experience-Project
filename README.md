 Current Bug List:

- Navbar's buttons cannot use href, so they are relatively useless since they cannot guide anyone anywhere

 Ideas:

- Javascript to support searching?

- Should we make every page the same in colour, font size, font type and make everything look similar rather than the main page being white and the pages I made are grey in background-colour?

+ Background color too dark - maybe #fcfcfc
--> Rudy: I suggest using #f1f1f1 instead of #fcfcfc it looks too much like white, furthermore, change all pages from #aaaaaa to #f1f1f1 because input boxes collide in colour when clicked to the wallpaper

- Put the trending cards into the page trending, this can make all the pages useful - G: On actual sites they have both but they have a more complete list on the trending page - think of the homepage as highlights

Ideas for Mobile Friendly...

- Index page: Make the two columns stack vertically and shrink the nav bar ( or make it button activated in JS )
   For mobile having the news/reviews tab overflow is alright/preferable - as atm it just goes down the page

Problems:
 
- User Profile and User Friends are quite hard to make since we have just got a prototype that cannot do anything. This is made out of javascript not python so it will not be our native programming language and we have only got tomorrow and half of Friday to work on making this work. Should we just make a prototype, which is just a hard-coded friend and a hard-coded profile, or should we risk it by making it in java tomorrow? 
G: just hard code them- if we ever feel like it we can do it after this week - i feel our main focus should be on the site itself.
