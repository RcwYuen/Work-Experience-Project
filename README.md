Current Bug List:

1.) Index Page: News Button does not go to www.bbc.co.uk: Fixing Method: Add http:// in front of www.bbc.co.uk - FIXED

2.) Index Page: The Ultimate Duck Hunting trending games does not go to exampleentry.html - this is because exampleentry.html isn't an example entry

3.) Index Page: The Ultimate Duck Hunting trending games button does not do anything. It only makes a long string of ULTIMATE DUCK HUNTING. - Not quite sure what this means - I set every game to the Duckhunt one as an example - and there isn't a trending button...

4.) Login and Register Page: The Cancel Button does not return the user to the index.html
