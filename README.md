 Current Bug List:

1.) Index Page: The Ultimate Duck Hunting trending games does not go to exampleentry.html - this is because exampleentry.html isn't an example entry

 Ideas:

- Make it mobile friendly?

- Javascript to support searching?

- Should we make every page the same in colour, font size, font type and make everything look similar rather than the main page being white and the pages I made are grey in background-colour?

+ tbh I'm not a fan of the current background colour - maybe make it a bit lighter?

Updates in Warwick Site for Guy:

- We are currently using margin-top 75px as universal to prevent the page's information from colliding with tom's task bar
